# Flutter Micro Lab #001 — Physics Button

A polished Flutter button that demonstrates how subtle animations can make a simple interaction feel more natural and responsive.

Instead of behaving like a static UI element, the button reacts to touch with realistic feedback—compressing when pressed and springing back into place on release—all using Flutter's built-in animation widgets.

## 🧠 Concepts Explored

This micro lab focuses on creating tactile UI interactions using Flutter's implicit animations.

Widgets used:

* `GestureDetector`
* `AnimatedScale`
* `AnimatedContainer`
* `AnimatedDefaultTextStyle`
* `Matrix4` transformations
* `Curves.elasticOut`

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the project and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

---

## 🎯 Goal

This experiment demonstrates that polished user experiences don't require complex physics engines or external packages.

By combining a few of Flutter's built-in animation widgets, it's possible to create interactions that feel more responsive, engaging, and enjoyable.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

No third-party packages are used.

Everything is built using Flutter's built-in framework.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Small interaction details often have a bigger impact on user experience than users consciously notice.

A button that compresses, bounces, and casts a dynamic shadow communicates responsiveness and quality, making the interface feel more refined and intuitive.

This lab explores one of those small details.
